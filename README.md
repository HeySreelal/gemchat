Gem Chat is your doorway to conversing with Gemini AI, Google's cutting-edge AI model, through the convenience of Telegram. This project serves as a simple yet powerful interface to interact with Google's Generative AI package for Dart, infused with a sprinkle of love for Telegram Bots.

Currently, Gem Chat supports text messages exclusively, but the roadmap includes exciting plans to incorporate image and file support in the near future.

## Usage

To get started with Gem Chat, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following commands:

```bash
dart pub get
dart run
```

## Environment Variables

Gem Chat relies on two crucial environment variables for seamless operation:

1. `BOT_TOKEN`: Obtain your Telegram Bot token from [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather).
2. `GOOGLE_AI_TOKEN`: Secure an API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/) to access the Google Generative AI.

With these environment variables properly configured, Gem Chat is ready to engage in intelligent conversations powered by Google's AI prowess.

### Example:
```
BOT_TOKEN=<your_telegram_bot_token>
GOOGLE_AI_TOKEN=<your_google_ai_token>
```

Embrace the potential of Gem Chat, where every conversation is an exploration into the realms of artificial intelligence.
